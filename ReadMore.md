## Grok it first, then pass the word, to people working with Sh Terminals

**You should feel agency and power**, when you work with a machine or a system.
You should feel you can change it, you should feel we've invited you to improve it.
You should feel that our pushback of "we've always done it this other way" can't stop you.
Else we've got it wrong

\- words by Cristóbal Sciutto, as remixed by me in June/2022

## Come to know you've got options you can afford

We're here picking out a way for you to **feel you're correcting the code in your Terminal Shell** - You aren't actually correcting any of the original broken things, not precisely, for on purpose we leave the originals in place undisturbed, for fixing them perturbs a million more things we'd have to manage well

But close enough

We're giving you **three gifts**, into the first minute after you download them

1 ) **your own examples**, at "P.py"

2 ) **your own notes**, at "P.py --h"

3 ) **your own tweaks** to defaults and behavior, at "P.py --"

For each plain old "P" defined by a File in your Sh Path, or defined as a Built-In Function inside your Sh Process

We're indexing these three gifts for you, by the 1st word of your next Sh Line

We're teaching you to drop these gifts into your own Sh Terminal Input Line Search Index, for you to find them again behind Dot Tab now, or to find them again after you fix them up

## Learn better, learn faster

Bring these gifts into your life, to serve as **things for you to think with**

**Bringing these in will noticeably accelerate the rate at which
you coin, pick up, and adopt new slang into your own Sh Command Line**

You won't get lost in coining too much new Sh slang too rapidly, and
you won't hide your Sh work away from people learning over your shoulder,
because we consciously keep up a strong trace of the laborious conventional old 1972 ways of saying what you mean

For example,
we make it quick and easy for you destroy every new file that you forgot to 'git add',
but not too easy

    $ git.py gcl
    did you mean:  git clean -ffxdq
    press ⌃D to execute, or ⌃C to quit

Ditto,
we make it quick and easy for you bury all your recent Commits into your 'git reflog',
but not too easy

    $ git.py grhu
    did you mean:  git reset --hard @{upstream}
    press ⌃D to execute, or ⌃C to quit

And when you forget the issue, we bring it back to you fast,
to bring you quickly back up to speed

    git.py gcl --h
    git.py grhu --h

And when you forget the examples, we bring those fast back to you too

    git.py

## Insist they give you mercy

Like ok so I must accept what happens when I strike Return after C D into a macOS Terminal.
Plebe that I am, I can't afford to push a broad distribution of change for the better there

But still they leave me safe and free to define what Return means after C D Dot Tab, and
after C D Dot Tab Dash Dash, and
after C D Dot Tab Dash Dash H

Suddenly now, my own two C D keys work for me too, no longer just for them - Suddenly now, for me too, their system has mercy

## Got it? Pay it forward?

Do you get it? Do you grok it?

Are our words here coherent enough that you get it, and focused well enough, ordered well enough, that you get it in a hurry?

If not, please tell us - we can make it better

If yes, please tell me you get it?

So far, besides me, i've found one friend who gets it enough to retweet it, back on 14/June/2022

How about we get things going now, passing the word out now

We want more and more people come meet with their chance of mercy,
lost and buried inside their Sh Terminals,
hidden away from me at least,
cross all these last fifty years.
Don't we?
