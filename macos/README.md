you can start now by reading the BUTTON\_FILE\_DOC
in the "[buttonfile.py](https://github.com/pelavarre/byobash/blob/main/macos/buttonfile.py#L51:~:text=(pycache_path)-,BUTTON_FILE_DOC,-%3D%20%22%22%22)"

that doc walks you through the macOS configuration tricks needed to make this work

this should work without reconfiguration,
    but we can't know if it works unless you test it for us,
        but i'm already willing to guess
            the Button Layouts don't reach you intact, as yet

in my first test, i double-click through ten Button Files

    Clear  1 , 2  Over Over +  Over Over +  ...

i push those ten Buttons
as shown inside the Finder > View > As Icons (⌘1) of this 'macos' Folder,
and then Finder > View > As List (⌘2) shows me the Fibonacci Numbers stacking up

we did get it wrong if we gave you this message
    while this much macOS reconfiguration is still too expensive for you

please check back a year from now

we'll move faster if you tell us that you're waiting on our progress
