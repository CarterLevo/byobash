dreaming since Jul/2022 =>

fill out the rest of Git Py

    alias q='git.py'
    alias qcd='git.py cd'
    ...

implement the rest of the Helped Examples
    cp.py
    mv.py
    ...

forward down the Path
    resolve the Path to give only first seen of each Real Path
        while dropping the absence of Real Path
    then find Self exactly once
        and forward to the Next After Self

form my own ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, from parts, as part of:  make push

easy grep of just dot configuration, without also picking up dot histoy


dreaming since Jun/2022 =>

ship 'README.py', not just 'README.md'

collapse '  &&: ' to '  # ' only when leading '  '  both present
    or some other way of remembering to insert both '  '


dreaming since May/2022 =>

ship better Arg Doc first
then drop better code into .py --python3
then run it at .py


earlier thoughts =>

cat.py
    'should work with my latest' was a note i took that meant something

pass through to next .py in the Sh Path chain
    and then to the next without Ext in the Sh Path chain
        except fall back to first of chain when self Not found

work more at

    clear.py sleep.py stty.py uptime.py watch.py

    cv

dream up a way to capture such idioms as

    id -un
    hostname
    echo $PWD

    git branch
    git log --oneline --no-decorate -1
    git describe --always --dirty

fill out tab-completion, such as recent host names for Ssh
