++ dreaming since Jul/2022 ++

same thing in a TUI, TUI in a GShell
--tui paper tape
main.stderr

add an Undo Button

= requests.get http://...
work with Files and Dirs, not just Maths
go with 'decimal.Decimal' over 'float'
consider '^' for 'pow' for decimal Int/ Float/ Decimal

factor the common code out from:  / * - +
refresh the 'macos/.DS_Store' often enough
    even though i often feel i have to log out to flush the Finder Cache of it


== ByoBash ==


++ dreaming since Jul/2022 ++

teach 'make style' to complain about leftover 'pdb.set_trace()' breakpoints

'qb/c' - calmer KeyboardInterrupt, and a full set of editing keystrokes

add cat.py, expand.py, vs Mac 'Illegal byte sequence's

adopt 'byo.stderr_print',
    across the files of 'import byotools as byo',
        in place of 'sys.stderr.write'

FIXME factor out a non-executable bin/pythonx.py, call it from python{3,2,}.py
FIXME Bash of Zsh: echo -ne '\e[8;50;89t'
FIXME the "  &&: # '", in place of "  &&: ", at such as:  ssh.py  &&:  # 'show these...
FIXME scroll-preserving clear is write empty lines for the rows, then destructive clear

implement the rest of the most prominently Helped Examples
    cp.py
    mv.py
    ...

solve 'qb/p'

Tab Completion in such places as:  mv -i *.
Tab Completion shouldn't require startswith, should care about history freq & recent

byo.exit_via_shpath_shverb:
forward down the Path
    resolve the Path to give only first seen of each Real Path
        while dropping the absence of Real Path
    then find Self exactly once
        and forward to the Next After Self
pass through to next .py in the Sh Path chain
    and then to the next without Ext in the Sh Path chain
        except fall back to first of chain when self Not found

form my own ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, from parts, as part of:  make push

easy grep of just dot configuration, without also picking up dot histoy

ship 'README.py', not just 'README.md'

collapse '  # ' to '  # ' only when leading '  '  both present
    or some other way of remembering to insert both '  '


++ dreaming since May/2022 ++

ship better Arg Doc first
then drop better code into .py --python3
then run it at .py

'shopt autocd' could take '/dev/null' as 'cat - >/dev/null'
'shopt autocd' could take '/dev/zero' as infinite Cpu 'cat /dev/zero |hexdump -C'


== earlier thoughts =>

work more at

    clear.py sleep.py stty.py uptime.py watch.py

fill out tab-completion, such as recent host names for Ssh
